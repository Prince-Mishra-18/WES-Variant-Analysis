🚀 Built an End-to-End Variant Calling Pipeline for Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) 🧬

Over the past few days, I worked on a hands-on bioinformatics project that mimics the real-world pipelines used in research labs and biotech companies.

Using real sequencing data from the NCBI SRA (SRR1952986), I built a complete WES analysis pipeline — from raw FASTQ files to identifying and prioritizing clinically relevant variants.

🔧 Pipeline Highlights:

📥 Downloaded WES data from SRA

✅ Quality checked reads using FastQC

🧬 Aligned to the human genome (hg38) using BWA-MEM

🔄 Sorted and indexed BAM files with SAMtools

🧪 Detected variants using GATK HaplotypeCaller

📊 Annotated SNVs with ANNOVAR using databases like refGene, dbNSFP, and ClinVar

🎯 Prioritized exonic, protein-altering variants with known or predicted clinical significance

📁 The entire project is organized for clarity and reproducibility — just like in real biotech workflows.

✅ What I learned:

Real-world genomics pipeline setup

Working with command-line tools & public data repositories

Variant interpretation based on biological & clinical relevance

🧠 This project strengthened my understanding of both the technical and analytical sides of NGS data analysis — a skill set that’s in demand in clinical genomics, precision medicine, and research.

If you're in genomics, bioinformatics, or hiring in this space — I’d love to connect and hear about how such pipelines are applied in your work!
